Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:Yes,three model architectures classified the breed of dog in basenji_01.jpg is Basenji.All three architectures classifed Correctly.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:Yes,three model architectures classified the breed of dog in basenji_02.jpg is Basenji.All three architectures classifed Correctly.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer:Yes,three models classifed both Animal_Name_01.jpg (black bear) and Object_Name_01.jpg (coffee mug) are not dogs. No misclassifications.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:All three models (VGG, ResNet, AlexNet) gave the same correct results for these images, so performance was equal. I would pick ResNet as the best, since it is a deeper and more modern architecture that usually gives stronger results on larger datasets.
